RyesVP In-App Notification Philosophy

Scope:
This covers in-app notifications only – the bell icon and the ephemeral toasts/banners inside the site. It does not define external channels (email, push, SMS).

1. Purpose

In-app notifications exist to:

Confirm that a social action really happened

“Your plan was created.”

“Maya was invited and notified.”

“Someone is covering your ticket.”

Provide a durable activity log

If you miss a toast, the bell still tells you what changed since you last visited.

They are not trying to be a real-time alert channel (no push, no guarantees of timing).

2. When we notify

We only generate notifications when something social and stateful happens – i.e., when another person’s experience or your commitments have changed.

We notify for:

Friend graph changes

You receive a friend request.

Your friend request is accepted.

Plan membership

You are added to a plan.

A plan you’re in is cancelled.

(Host only) Someone joins or leaves your plan.

Ticket coverage

Someone covers your ticket for an event.

(Optionally) You start covering tickets for others.

We do not notify for low-signal activity like:

“X marked Interested in Y.”

Passive browsing.

3. Feedback style: toast + log

We use a two-layer pattern:

Toast (ephemeral)

Shows immediately after you take an action.

Non-blocking, auto-dismisses.

Used to reassure the actor:

“Plan created…”

“We added Alex and Maya and notified them.”

Often includes a contextual CTA:

Copy plan link

Notification bell (durable)

Stores notifications for recipients of actions:

“You were added to a plan…”

“@X sent you a friend request.”

Lets people catch up on changes whenever they next visit.

Rule of thumb:

If an action affects other people or materially changes a shared plan, it should:

Show a toast to the actor, and

Create a bell notification for the recipients.

4. Consistency across flows

We apply the same feedback pattern across:

Plan creation

Toast to creator (“Plan created…”)

Notifications to auto-added friends.

Inviting friends to an existing plan

Toast to inviter (“We added X and Y…”)

Notifications to invitees.

Friend requests

Toast to sender (“Friend request sent…”)

Notification to recipient.

Ticket coverage

Toast to buyer (“You’re handling tickets for…”)

Notification to covered members.

This keeps the mental model simple:

“When I do something social, I see a little confirmation.
The people I involve see it under the bell.
