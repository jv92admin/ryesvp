This makes sense, and your ask is clear:
**First: define the philosophy.
Then: walk channel-by-channel with opportunities + why.**

I’ll do exactly that, and keep it high-level enough that we can plug deeper UX details into it later.

---

## 1. RyesVP engagement philosophy

*(How we decide what goes where)*

Think of this as the “constitution” everything else has to follow.

1. **Real-world plans > app time**

   * The goal of engagement is *better nights out with people you care about*, not raw time-in-app.
   * If a touchpoint doesn’t make someone’s planning or experience meaningfully better, we don’t ship it.

2. **UI first, channels as escalations**

   * Default: all activity is visible and actionable inside RyesVP (feeds, squad pages, notifications bar).
   * Email and SMS exist to *extend* access when you’re not in the app, not to replace the core UX.

3. **No “empty” or bait notifications**

   * Every notification/email/SMS must be tied to something concrete:

     * A friend/squad/community action,
     * An event you’re attached to,
     * A meaningful change to a plan.
   * No generic “we miss you, come back” pings.

4. **Respect the user’s current channel**

   * If we ask you to do something in email, you should usually be able to complete that action *in email* (e.g., reply “I’m in, need 1 ticket” and we parse it).
   * We *can* invite you into the app for richer context, but we don’t *force* that for simple actions.

5. **We are not a messaging app**

   * No full chat / DM system.
   * No attempt to replace WhatsApp/iMessage/IG.
   * Any “text” UX we add (Squad Notes, event notes) is for **sticky, shared context**, not live chatter.

6. **SMS is last-mile, not a social channel**

   * SMS is for “you are going somewhere soon; this will help you right now.”
   * No inbound SMS flows (for now).
   * No SMS for friend requests, invites, or general engagement.

7. **Organic discovery over dark patterns**

   * We make the most of organic “I clicked a link / got invited / got an email” moments.
   * But we do not build loops whose only purpose is to maximize clicks or opens.
   * The question is always: *“Is this genuinely useful for someone who likes going out?”*

If we keep these in view, it becomes much easier to answer “should this live in the app, email, or SMS?”

## 2. Channels: roles + opportunities + why

Now let’s walk channel by channel. Think of this as a skeleton—we’ll hang specific flows on it later.

---

### A. In-app (product UI, including notification bar)

**Role**
The *canonical brain* of RyesVP.
If you open the app, you should be able to see and act on everything important without checking anything else.

**What belongs here**

* **Notification bar / bell list**

  * Friend requests
  * Community invites
  * Squads you’ve been added to / invited to
  * Key changes to events you’re attached to (time, venue, headcount decisions)

* **Feeds / discovery surfaces**

  * Calendar with events
  * “Friends are going to…” / “Your orbit” style modules
  * Communities and scenes (Austin Indie, Comedy, etc.)

* **Squad pages**

  * Structured state (Going / Maybe / Out, ticket status, guests, budget, etc.)
  * **Squad Notes / Event Notes**:

    * “Bringing my dad + 1 friend”
    * “Host says BYOB”
    * “We’re aiming for GA floor, not seats”
    * Think bulletin, not chat.

* **Friend / community lists**

  * Who’s in your graph
  * What they’re into / going to
  * Simple actions: add, accept, join.

**Why this matters**

* It gives you a single, predictable place to understand “my nightlife graph + plans”.
* It allows us to keep external channels polite and sparse, because *everything* is always visible here when you choose to come in.

### B. Email (outbound + reply-to-act)

**Role**
Recap + social reactivation + “concierge actions” when you’re not in the app.

**De-prioritized / excluded**

* No real-time “play-by-play” of every tiny change.
* No “pure marketing” blasts with no clear user value.

**Opportunities & why**

1. **Social graph & invite summaries**

   * Trigger: you’ve been inactive for X days and have meaningful social activity.
   * Content:

     * Friend requests
     * Community invites
     * New squads you were added to
   * Why: keeps you aware of real social pull without hammering you with individual emails.

2. **Squad / event invitation emails**

   * Trigger: you’re added to or invited to a Squad for an event.
   * Content:

     * Clear summary: what event, who’s involved, key details.
     * Ask: “Tell us how you feel about this event.”
   * **Reply-to-act**:

     * You can reply with natural language (“I’m in, need 1 ticket, don’t want to spend over $80”).
     * LLM parses and updates Squad state.
     * We send a confirmation email.
   * Why: lets you participate in plans *from your inbox* without forcing a login just to toggle “Going.”

3. **Weekly (or occasional) digest**

   * Trigger: optional once the graph has some density.
   * Content:

     * Events coming up this week that involve your friends / squads.
     * Maybe “just listed” / presale-ish items that match your existing tastes.
   * Why:

     * Gently keeps RyesVP in your mental rotation.
     * Frames us as “your weekly heads up for what your people are doing,” not as a firehose.

4. **Transactional confirmations**

   * After reply parsing:

     * “We’ve marked you as Going + 1 ticket needed.”
   * After big changes:

     * “Your Squad meetup time for [Event] is now 7:30pm.”
   * Why: closes the loop and builds trust in the concierge behavior.

---

### C. SMS (outbound only, later; inbound explicitly out of scope for now)

**Role**
Day-of or near-day-of last-mile logistics. Only when timing matters.

**What we *don’t* do**

* No SMS for:

  * friend requests
  * community invites
  * generic “come back” reminders
  * inbound “text us back and we’ll parse it” (for now, explicitly out)

**Opportunities & why**

1. **Day-before / day-of event reminders**

   * “You’re going to [Event] tomorrow with [Squad name].”
   * “Doors in 2 hours. Meetup: [Spot].”
   * Why: this is when people actually need timely info and might not be checking email/app.

2. **Critical last-minute changes**

   * “Venue changed.”
   * “Door time moved by 1 hour.”
   * Why: prevents “I didn’t see that” disasters.

Everything else lives in email or in-app. SMS is the emergency lane.

---

### D. Off-site / deep links (shared links, invites from other channels)

**Role**
Handle organic discovery without being a wall.

**Opportunities & why**

1. **Event links shared in chats / socials**

   * Landing: direct to event page (mobile web or app).
   * Micro-copy:

     * “This is an event on RyesVP — see who’s going, or just use it as a clean event page.”
   * Why: honors the intent (“I clicked an event”) while lightly introducing the broader product.

2. **Squad invite links**

   * Landing: Squad preview with:

     * Basic info
     * Who’s in / invited
     * CTA to respond (in app or, if from email, via reply).
   * Why: makes joining a Squad feel simple and non-ceremonial.

3. **Community / profile links**

   * Less critical early, but same pattern:

     * Show the object first (community description / user public profile).
     * Then optional “this lives in RyesVP” explanation.
   * Why: keeps “I clicked a link” moments feeling organic, not sales-y.

## 3. Where we go from here

We now have:

* A **philosophy** (the rules of what should go where, and why).
* A **channel skeleton** with:

  * Roles
  * Engagement opportunities
  * A clear “why” behind each, aligned to your values.

Next logical steps (when you’re ready) could be:

* Within **in-app**, go surface by surface:

  * Feeds
  * Squad pages (including Squad Notes)
  * Friend lists
  * Notification bar
    and jot down “what are the meaningful engagement moments here?”

* Or within **email**, draft 2–3 **example emails**:

  * A Squad invite email with reply-to-act.
  * A weekly digest skeleton.
  * A “you have new friend/community activity” summary.

We can treat each of those as separate little workstreams and refine them one by one without losing this overarching philosophy.
