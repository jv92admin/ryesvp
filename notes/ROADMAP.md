## Block A: Event Discovery Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**See:** `specs/event-discovery-spec.md` for full details.

All phases (0–1.6) complete. 19 venue scrapers, 700+ events, 500+ performers, fuzzy search, instant-apply filters. Key design decisions documented in `architecture/data-model.md`.

---

## Block B: UX Quick Wins

**Goal:** Polish UX before inviting real users.

Friend Links, Group Links, and Onboarding are complete. Remaining:

### Transactional Emails

**Goal:** Basic transactional emails for key moments.

**Emails to Build:**
- [ ] Welcome email (on signup)
  - "This is a small community project"
  - How to start a plan, how to invite friends
  - Privacy reassurance
- [ ] "You were added to a plan" email
- [ ] "Your event is tomorrow" reminder email

**Email Philosophy:**
- Low risk, high clarity
- Reply-to-act where possible (parse "I'm in, need 1 ticket")
- No journeys/drip campaigns yet — just transactional

### UX Bug Fixes

- [ ] Issues identified during Event Discovery build
- [ ] Any other friction points

---

## Block C: User Testing Pause

**Goal:** Validate foundation before investing in enrichment.

**Activities:**
- [ ] Invite 20-30 real users
- [ ] Collect feedback on event discovery, search, plan creation
- [ ] Fix top issues
- [ ] Huddle on technical roadmap for enrichment (Block D)

**Exit criteria:** TBD by PM based on user feedback.

---

## Block D: Data Enrichment & Personalization

**See:** `specs/event-discovery-spec.md` Phases 2-3 for full details.

### Event Discovery Phase 2: Data Enrichment

**Goal:** Enrich events, venues, and performers based on user feedback.

- 2.1 Enrichment use case selection (with PM)
- 2.2 Enrichment schema design
- 2.3 Venue enrichment
- 2.4 Event enrichment
- 2.5 Performer enrichment
- 2.6 Discovery upgrade (new filters based on enrichment)

### Event Discovery Phase 3: Personalization + Spotify

**Goal:** Personalized recommendations based on music taste.

- 3.1 Spotify OAuth flow
- 3.2 Fetch user's top artists, match to Performers
- 3.3 "For You" surface based on preferences

---

## Deferred Work

### Create-Your-Own Event (was Phase 4A)

**Deferred because:** Core loop works well with scraped events. User events add complexity (moderation, spam, visibility). Will revisit after Event Discovery proves useful.

**When ready:**
- `/events/new` page
- Fields: Title, Date/time, Location (text + optional map), URL (optional), Description
- Creates event with `source: 'USER_CREATED'`
- Event page IS the plan (like Partiful)
- Invite friends flow

### Communities v1 (was Phase 7)

**Deferred because:** Communities need people to show up — ship last.

**When ready:**
- Plan → Community relation
- Start plan from community
- Simple community feed

## Backlog (Future / Unscheduled)

### Discovery & Content
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Discover Page (`/discover`) | Stub page → evolves into taste setup, tag browsing, "For You". Entry point from filter strip. |
| Clickable Tags on Event Cards | Tap genre/tag → filter events or open Discover pre-filtered. Subtle styling, hover feedback. |
| Typeahead Search Suggestions | As-you-type dropdown: performers, events, tags. Phase 2 of search. |
| Smart Search (NL) | "Jazz concerts this weekend" → structured search. See event-discovery-spec Phase 4. |
| Performer/Venue Pages | Full `/performers/[slug]` and `/venues/[slug]` pages. See event-discovery-spec Phase 4.3. |
| Performer Follow + Notify | Follow button → notification when followed performer has new show. |
| "New to You" Badges | `lastVisitAt` exists. Build UI for "new since last visit" indicators on events. |
| Medium Events (Indie Venues) | Curated smaller venues (bars, indie rooms). High effort/maintenance. V2+ flavor. |

### Social & Friends
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| "Start Plan with X" | From friend profile, start a plan and auto-invite that friend. |
| Friend Avatar Popover | Hover on avatar → quick actions popover. Currently all click → profile. |
| Discovery Chips: Friends Going | Friends Going filter chip on event list. |
| Discovery Chips: Trending | Trending chip based on friend/community activity. |
| Activity Feed | Real-time friend/community activity in sidebar. Requires activity logging. |
| Soft Reputation | Show-up signals, ticket trust. After communities. |

### Plans & Coordination
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Plan Notes (Bulletin Board) | Freeform notes ("BYOB", "Meet at east entrance"). Price Guide covers structured now. |
| Playlist within Plans | "Here's what we're listening to before the show." Spotify link or embed. |
| Plan Link Onboarding | Currently `/squads/[id]` requires login. Add join flow for non-users (preview → sign up → auto-join). |

### Communities (when ready to reveal)
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Community UI Reveal | Surface hidden groups as named communities with settings. |
| Community Settings | Auto-friend toggle, link expiry, multiple invite links. |
| Group Size Limits | Cap auto-friend groups at N members to prevent abuse. |
| Community Feed | Simple activity feed per community. |

### Onboarding & Engagement
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Taste Setup Onboarding | First-run flow: "Pick artists, tags, scenes, venues you like." Seeds preferences for recommendations. |
| Taste Graph | Attendance history + playlist + friend overlap → preference profile. Powers "For You." |
| Announcement Sequencing | Queue tips/feature announcements with priority + conditions. Foundation ready (lastVisitAt, engagement API). |
| Email Journeys | Multi-step flows, re-engagement. After transactional emails prove out. |

### Technical / Infrastructure
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Job Run Database Logging | Store job results in `JobRun` table for admin dashboard. |
| Performer Data Cleanup | Remove legacy artist fields from Enrichment model. |
| Dark Mode Polish | Exists but not styled. |

### Communications (Beyond Transactional)
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Email Reply-to-Act | Reply "I'm in, need 1 ticket" → parsed and updates status. |
| Weekly Digest Email | Events this week + "just listed" matching your tastes. Opt-in. |
| SMS Day-of Logistics | "Tonight: 5:30 Drinks → 8:00 Show." Last-mile only, not engagement. |

### Account & Privacy
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|
| Data Export (GDPR) | Export user data before deletion. |
| Soft Delete / Grace Period | Recovery window before permanent account deletion. |

### Moonshots
| Item | Notes |
|------|-------|

| Conversational Planning | "Add me to the Khruangbin plan" via SMS → parsed and executed. |
