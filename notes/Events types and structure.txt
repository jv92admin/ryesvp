RyesVP – Event Types & “Plan the Day” Vision
0. Purpose & Scope
This doc is about how RyesVP structures “going out” in Austin:


The three main event types we care about:


Large, ticketed shows (big venues)


Medium “around town” events (bars, smaller venues)


People-created events (friend/hosted, Partiful-style)




A fourth concept that sits on top of events:


Planning a day / night via Squad Stops inside squad pages




This is a vision-level document.
Any SQL / TypeScript shapes are conceptual only. A future PM/eng pass can turn this into actual tasks, migrations, and components.

1. Event Taxonomy – The Three Types
RyesVP is not “all events everywhere.” It’s:

The easiest way for me and my friends to say yes to going out in Austin.

To support that, we distinguish three event types:


Large Events – big shows, arenas, major venues


Medium Events (“Around Town”) – curated subset of smaller bars/rooms


People-Created Events – social events hosted by users (Partiful lane)


1.1 Large Events (Primary Feed Backbone)
Definition


Ticketed concerts, arena shows, major comedy tours, theatre, etc.


Venues that seat, say, 500+ (conceptual threshold, not enforced in UI)


Data source primarily: Ticketmaster (Discovery API), plus large venue sites.


Why they matter


They’re the anchor of many nights out.


They’re where squads form and where the “Plan the Day” layer shines.


They’re the least controversial to ingest and easiest to keep accurate.


UX / UI Behavior


Large cards in the feed, with:


Artist/event image


Event name


Venue, date/time


“X friends going / interested” if applicable




Tappable into a full event page with:


Event details


Squad entry/creation


“Who’s going / interested” summary




Product Focus


Lowest ongoing strategic risk and lowest PM attention needed.


Major work is:


Solid ingestion


Good dedupe logic


Good mapping into internal event schema




We don’t need to innovate here beyond making this data social and usable.



1.2 Medium Events – “Around Town”
Definition


Smaller shows at bars, local comedy clubs, independent rooms.


Things like: Creek & Cave sets, small music stages, indie rooms, etc.


Not trivia/ultra-indie chaos at scale; more like “curated local shows”.


Why they matter


They make the feed feel alive and Austin-specific.


They add context: “stuff happening around town” beyond just big tours.


They support the “I want to get deep in Austin, not go multi-city” thesis.


Realistic Tradeoffs


Highest effort / maintenance per unit value:


Scraping janky sites


IG-only announcements


Inconsistent schedules




Medium reward:


Nice flavor, but not the primary reason people use RyesVP


Coverage expectations creep if we’re not careful




Strategy


Curated, not comprehensive.


We maintain a small, opinionated list of venues whose event pages are:


Stable, structured (or at least parseable)


Culturally relevant to our target users




For v1, medium events may:


Use the same card/event page as large events (indistinguishable)


OR just have a subtle chip like Local Show / Around Town.




Product Focus


Not a core v1 focus.


Treated as a v2+ enhancement:


Once the main flows for large events + squads are solid


Once we’re confident we can maintain a small curated set without constant breakage





1.3 People-Created Events – “Social Events” (Partiful Lane)
Definition


Events fully created and hosted by users, e.g.:


Thanksgiving dinner


Wine night


Halloween party


Game night


House show


Watch party, birthday, etc.




Positioning


This competes directly in the Partiful space:


Hosted event pages


Friend invitations


RSVP flows




We’re not shy about that; we’re happy to live in that world.


How they differ from Large/Medium events


Host-centric: “Hosted by Maya,” not “at Moody Center.”


Social graph-centric: friends, communities, invite-only.


Partiful-like landing page:


Cover image


Title


Date/time


Location (can be fuzzy: “my place,” “TBD bar downtown”)


Description


RSVPs (going / maybe / not going)


Optional “what to bring” or notes




Event Page Behavior


The event page itself is effectively the squad:


You don’t need a separate “squad overlay” model here—this is the planning layer.


“Who’s going / interested” is baked into the event.


A simplified “Plan the day” block can still exist (e.g. pregame stops / afterparty).




Feed Behavior


Appears in the main feed, alongside large & medium events, but with:


Friend avatars instead of artist images


A Hosted by [Friend] line


Maybe a Friends’ Event or Social chip to distinguish it at a glance.




Why this is a big thesis bet


This is where RyesVP stops being “events + social overlay” and becomes:

“Where my people host and plan nights.”



This is unique data:


Nobody else has “wine night at V’s place with these 8 friends.”


This builds true retention and social gravity.





2. The Fourth Concept: “Plan the Day” via Squad Stops
Separate from event types is a cross-cutting concept:

Planning the day / night around an event.

This is not another event type. It’s a planning layer that sits inside Squads for any event (large or social; medium later if we care).
Right now, this lives in the “logistics” section. The vision is:


Rename/reframe Logistics → Plan the day.


Keep the implementation lightweight.


Make it:


Useful for the night-of


The backbone for emails/texts


The foundation for future “curate my day” flows




2.1 Squad Stops – Concept
Current, intentionally simple definition:
For now, a Squad Stop is just:


time – when (optional)


date – usually implied by the event date; can store full timestamp


text – freeform label (place name, instructions, link, etc.)


Users can type anything in text:


“Drinks at Lazarus (https://maps.app.goo.gl/...)”


“Walk over to Moody by 7:15”


“Late-night tacos at Tyson’s”


We’re explicitly not over-modeling this right now.
Conceptual shape (TypeScript-ish)
// Conceptual only; final schema to be scoped later
type SquadStop = {
  id: string;
  squadId: string;
  // Minimal for now:
  dateTime?: string; // ISO string, optional
  text: string;      // "Drinks at Lazarus – https://maps..."
  order: number;     // for ordering in the UI
};

Conceptual SQL/Prisma-ish:
// Conceptual model – subject to change
model SquadStop {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  squadId   String
  squad     Squad    @relation(fields: [squadId], references: [id])

  dateTime  DateTime?
  text      String
  order     Int

  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}

Again: these are conceptual, not final contracts.
2.2 How Squad Stops Surface in the UI
Squad page layout vision
We think of the squad model as having two “modes” or “windows”:


Plan the event (top / first)


Who’s going


Who’s interested


Ticket status (who has tickets, who doesn’t)


Seat/section info (lightweight seat map later)


Invite/share squad




Plan the day (second view / bottom / tab)


Weather


“Know before you go” (bag policy, etc.)


Squad Stops timeline: simple list of times + freeform text




In v1, this might be vertically stacked:


Top: Plan the event


Bottom: Plan the day


Later, we can make it a tabbed/swipeable model:


[Plan the event]   [Plan the day]


so we don’t crush vertical real estate on mobile.
Plan the day content (MVP)


Weather snippet (at event time)


Know-before-you-go info (from Ticketmaster / venue)


SquadStops list, e.g.:


5:30 — “Drinks at Lazarus – map link”


7:15 — “Walk to Moody Center”


8:00 — “Show starts”




“Add a stop” is a simple dialog:


Date/time (optional)


Freeform text


No structured maps/Uber integration required yet. Users can paste links.
2.3 Uber / Maps Ideas (Conceptual Only)
Future–possible integrations:


A “Call a ride” button that:


Opens the Uber app (generic), or


Opens Google Maps/Apple Maps with a destination (last stop, venue, etc.)




Auto-suggesting map links for known venues or popular spots.


For now, we treat these as conceptual add-ons:


We don’t model destinations formally.


We allow users to paste map links into text if they care.


2.4 How “Plan the Day” Drives Comms
The “Plan the day” section becomes the source of truth for time-based messaging:


Day-of / 24h email:


“You’re going with 4 friends.”


Weather summary.


Know-before-you-go bullets.


A rendered version of SquadStops (timeline).




Day-of SMS (if/when we do it):


“Tonight, [Artist @ Venue]. Plan: [5:30 Drinks @ X → 8:00 Show]. Details: [link].”




We can later use an LLM to turn the structured data (weather, stops, policies, tickets) into a human-feeling email—but the raw content still comes from:


Event data


Ticketmaster “know before you go”


Weather API


SquadStops



3. Future: “Curate My Day” (Explicitly Long-Term)
We intentionally do not commit to:


Auto-curating full days.


Recommending bars + dinner + shows in one click.


Taste-modeling around neighborhoods.


But we acknowledge the long-term potential:


Starting from a show → “Suggest a pregame + dinner nearby.”


Starting from a date → “Build a plan anchored around this show.”


Auto-filling 1–3 SquadStops and letting users edit.


If we get there, it’s just:

An engine that creates SquadStops + maybe picks a show.

We don’t need new primitives; we just populate existing ones.
For now, this sits in the “Later / V3+ thesis” bucket.

4. Relative Focus
To make priorities explicit:


Large events


Core backbone


Already mostly solvable via APIs and a simple ingestion pipeline.


Need the least conceptual focus going forward.




Medium “around town” events


We recognize their charm but also the cost.


Strategy is to:


Identify a small set of stable, culturally relevant venues.


Treat this as a curated V2 enhancement.


Avoid “we list literally everything” expectations.






People-created events


Major strategic focus area.


This is where we intentionally overlap with Partiful.


We differentiate by:


Tying into existing friends/squads


Living in the same ecosystem as big shows


Reusing our planning and comms stack






Plan the day (SquadStops)


Major thesis #2.


Becomes the “brain” for:


How squads coordinate around events


How emails/texts summarize the night


How future “curate a day” features are expressed







5. Open Questions / To be defined later
These are deliberately not solved in this doc:


Exact schemas & migrations


Final Event, Squad, SquadStop, and SocialEvent models.


How we differentiate large/medium/social events in the DB vs the UI.




Permissions & editing rules


Who can add/edit SquadStops?


For social events: does every guest edit details, or just hosts?




Notification matrix


Exactly when pre-event emails/texts fire per user.


How friend requests / community invites tie into these flows.




Medium-event venue list


Which specific Austin bars/venues qualify as “curated around-town” sources.


What condition makes them worth ingesting.




Visual differentiation


Exact card styles for:


Big shows


Local shows


Social/friend events




Exact layout for the “Plan the event / Plan the day” windows in the squad.





6. Summary
We’re converging on two big thesis ideas:


RyesVP = Events with Friends


Large shows as the data backbone.


Medium events as curated flavor.


People-created events as a real Partiful-class feature, integrated into the same social graph and feed.




RyesVP = Plan the Night, Not Just the Show


Plan the day (via SquadStops) evolves from a basic logistics section into:


An informal, user-driven mini-itinerary


A home for weather + know-before-you-go


The source of truth for day-of emails/texts




Future curation (“build my night”) is layered on top of these primitives, not designed from scratch.




We’ll use this as a vision backbone, and later, a PM/eng pass can turn each part into concrete stories, schemas, and UI specs.
