Your Reality Check
You don't have a network yet.
I was arguing "user events unlock network effects" but you need a network first for that to matter. If you have 20 users with 2-3 friends each, user-created events won't fill a calendar - they'll just add 2-3 scattered wine nights to a feed that still feels sparse.
Partiful exists and works.
You're right - users already have a solution for "I'm hosting a thing." The bar isn't "can create event," it's "better than Partiful." Your MVP wouldn't clear that bar. So why switch? They'll just keep using both apps, which fragments coordination.
Your cold start problem is different.
You need to give people a reason to:
Check RyesVP daily (discovery habit)
Invite friends (because there's something to coordinate around)
Actually use it for coordination (not just browsing)
Right now, you're competing for attention with:
Instagram (where they see what friends are doing)
Event listings (where they find shows)
Group chats (where they coordinate)
You need to win ONE of those before adding more surface area.
The Case for Discovery Infrastructure
What you're actually saying:
> "Make finding something fun to do feel MAGICAL first. Then I'll have users worth building network effects for."
This is correct. Let me argue your side properly:
1. Rich Discovery = Single-Player Mode That Works
Users don't need friends yet if discovery feels good. Think:
Spotify (works great with zero friends)
Letterboxd (fun to browse alone, better with friends)
Airbnb (discovery is the product)
If browsing RyesVP for "what's happening this weekend" feels better than:
Checking 6 venue websites
Scrolling Ticketmaster's messy feed
Instagram event posts you half-remember
Then you have utility without network effects. People will use it ALONE first. That's your wedge.
2. You Can Announce User Events as a Launch Moment
"RyesVP now works for YOUR events too" is a marketing beat.
Right now you're in private beta / friends-and-family. When you're ready to actually "launch" to a wider Austin audience, user events is your news hook:
> "RyesVP: The Austin calendar that learns your taste - now you can add your own events too"
That's a product evolution story. Timing it right makes it an unlock, not just another feature.
3. Discovery Infrastructure Has Compound Returns
Every improvement to discovery helps:
Search - makes 500 events usable, scales to 5000
Better metadata - powers recommendations, filters, social signals
More venues - more surface area for friends to overlap on
Related events - "going to X? also check out Y"
These build on each other. User events don't make discovery better. Discovery makes everything better.
4. The "Antone's Moment" is Real Differentiation
Your example is perfect. Someone discovers:
A jazz show at Antone's they never would've found
An experimental theater thing at The Off Center
A DJ set at Mohawk's outdoor stage
These are the "oh this app gets Austin" moments. They don't exist on Ticketmaster. They barely exist anywhere aggregated well.
If you nail this, you become "the Austin scene calendar" not "event coordination software." That's a moat.
What "Magical Discovery" Actually Means
Let's get concrete. What would make discovery feel magical vs. utilitarian?
Tier 1: Table Stakes (You Need This)
Search (3 days)
Full-text search: title, performer, venue, description
Filters: date range, category, venue, price-free-only
Search while typing (debounced)
"No results" state with suggestions
More Event Coverage (ongoing)
Add 8-10 mid-size venues (clubs, theaters, comedy)
SeatGeek API (different inventory than TM)
~1000-1500 events in system at any time
This gets you to "comprehensive enough that I check here first."
Tier 2: Smart Discovery (This is the Magic)
Genre/Vibe Tags (3-4 days)
Beyond just CONCERT/COMEDY/THEATER
Tags like: indie, electronic, country, punk, family-friendly, outdoor, late-night
Auto-tag via LLM + Spotify genres
Filter by multiple tags
"More like this" button
Related Events (2-3 days)
"Going to Khruangbin? Also check out:"
Same genre shows that week
Same venue other dates
Artists with similar Spotify profiles
Sidebar on event detail page
"Discover" Feed Separate from Calendar (3-5 days)
Default view: chronological calendar (what you have)
New tab: "Discover" - personalized/curated feed
New since last visit (you track this with "NEW" badge already)
Friends going (you have this)
Matches your taste (based on what you've RSVP'd to + Spotify later)
"Hidden gems" (under-the-radar shows)
Smart Sorting Options
Chronological (default)
"Popular with friends"
"New listings"
"Last chance" (happening soon, tickets still available)
Tier 3: Taste Profile (The Moat)
Implicit Taste Learning (foundational for later)
Track: what users mark Going/Interested
Extract: genres, venues, artists from those events
Store: taste vector per user (even if you don't expose it yet)
This is data collection for future recommendation engine. Don't need to show it yet, just start capturing it.
Explicit Taste (Later/Optional)
"What genres do you like?" onboarding
Follow venues
Follow artists (Phase 5)
Spotify connect (Phase 6)
My Revised Recommendation: 3-Week Discovery Sprint
Week 1: Search + Metadata Foundation
[ ] Full-text search (Postgres FTS)
[ ] Search UI with filters
[ ] Genre/vibe tagging system (LLM-extracted)
[ ] Add genre tags to EventCard
Output: Search works, events have richer metadata
Week 2: Venue Expansion + Coverage
[ ] Add 8-10 more venues (prioritize variety: clubs, comedy, theater, outdoor)
[ ] SeatGeek API integration (reuse your TM matching approach)
[ ] Audit: get to ~1000+ events in system
Output: Calendar feels comprehensive
Week 3: Discovery Features
[ ] Related events sidebar
[ ] "Discover" feed (separate from calendar)
[ ] Smart sorting options
[ ] Start tracking user taste data (Going/Interested analysis)
Output: Discovery feels smart, not just comprehensive
Venues to Add (My Suggestions)
Current 6 venues are all 1000+ capacity, mostly mainstream. Add diversity:
Clubs/Music (200-500 cap):
Antone's (your example - blues/rock)
Mohawk (indie/punk, indoor + outdoor)
Empire Control Room (electronic/indie)
The Scoot Inn (outdoor, eclectic)
Comedy:
Creek and the Cave (comedy club)
Fallout Theater (improv)
Cap City Comedy Club
Theater/Arts:
The Off Center (experimental)
Ground Floor Theatre
Austin Scottish Rite Theater
Outdoor/Misc:
Zilker Park (festivals, movies in the park)
Long Play Lounge East (listening bar - if they do events)
This gets you genre diversity + capacity diversity + "Austin flavor" venues.
The Metrics That Matter
After this sprint, you should be able to say:
Coverage:
✅ 1000+ events in system
✅ 15+ venues (mainstream + indie + comedy + theater)
✅ Shows in next 90 days for every weekend
Usability:
✅ Search finds relevant events in <1 second
✅ Can filter to "indie shows this weekend under $30"
✅ Related events surface 3-5 good suggestions
Discovery:
✅ "Discover" feed shows different events than calendar
✅ Genre tags help users browse by vibe
✅ Most events have rich metadata (image, genres, description)
Taste Data:
✅ Tracking what each user marks Going/Interested
✅ Can generate "genres you like" for each user (even if not shown yet)
Then What?
After 3 weeks, you have:
A genuinely comprehensive Austin events calendar
Discovery that feels magical, not utilitarian
Data foundation for personalization
Then you can:
Do a small launch - "RyesVP: Your Austin events calendar" to grow to 100+ users
Let network effects build - more users = more friend overlaps
Ship user events (3-4 months from now) when network is big enough to matter
OR
Skip to Spotify integration - use taste data you've collected + OAuth to do "your top artists playing in Austin"
The Thing I Was Wrong About
I argued: "User events unlock week 2 retention."
What I missed: You don't have enough users for week 2 retention to matter yet.
Your actual blocker is getting to 100+ users who check the app weekly. That requires the single-player discovery experience to be great.
You're right. Build the discovery foundation first.
One Last Thing: Can you do 80% of this in 2 weeks instead of 3?
Search (3 days)
Add 5 venues instead of 10 (4 days)
Genre tagging (2 days)
Related events (2 days)
Basic taste tracking (1 day)
Skip "Discover feed" for now, keep chronological calendar but with better search/filters/tags.
That gets you to "good enough to show people" in 2 weeks. Then assess if you need more venues or can move to next phase.



**YES. THIS IS IT.**

You just described the actual moat. Let me show you why this compounds:

## The Compounding Vision

**Current State:**
- Event title + date + venue
- Some have Spotify link, some have genres
- Calendar view, basic filters

**Your Vision:**
- Rich metadata on every event (genres, vibes, tags, performers, price tier, audience type)
- Spotify OAuth → "Khruangbin is playing next week" (you already listen to them)
- Natural language search → "chill outdoor shows under $40"
- Sports calendar → comprehensive weekend coverage
- All powered by ONE data structure

**Why this is brilliant:**

Every data field you add unlocks MULTIPLE features:
- `familyFriendly` tag → filter, LLM search understands it, shows in event details
- `priceRange` → filter by budget, LLM search, "cheap shows" feed
- `vibe` tags → related events, taste matching, discovery feed
- Spotify artist links → personalization, "artists you love", follow features

You're right: **The schema is the foundation. Fill it once, use it everywhere.**

## The Spotify Unlock is HUGE

Let me paint the picture:

**Login with Spotify Flow:**
```
1. User connects Spotify
2. Fetch their top 50 artists (one API call)
3. Match against events in your DB (via spotify artist links you already have)
4. Show: "12 artists you listen to are playing in Austin in the next 90 days"
```

**This is your killer feature.**

Nobody else does this well:
- Ticketmaster doesn't know your taste
- Bandsintown is clunky and misses local shows
- Instagram is manual following

You have the enrichment pipeline to make this work. And once you have their Spotify profile, you can:
- Recommend events based on similar artists
- "Your friends also listen to X"
- Genre-based discovery
- Create shared playlists for plans (future)

**Spotify OAuth is probably 2-3 days of work** and it's the most "magical" feature you could ship.

## The LLM Search Feature (Beta/Limited)

This is smart to gate as beta. Here's the simple version:

**User types:** "indie shows this weekend under $30"

**LLM parses to:**
```json
{
  "genres": ["indie", "alternative", "rock"],
  "dateRange": ["2025-12-06", "2025-12-08"],
  "maxPrice": 30,
  "vibe": "chill"
}
```

**You query DB with those filters** → return results

**Why this works with limited calls:**
- Cache common queries ("this weekend", "tonight", "cheap shows")
- Only call LLM if query is complex/ambiguous
- Fall back to standard search if LLM fails
- Rate limit per user (5 AI searches per day for beta)

**Even simpler v1:**
- Only enable for premium/beta testers
- Manual approval to use feature (keeps costs down)
- Show as "✨ Ask RyesVP (Beta)" search mode toggle

This is 2-3 days of work on top of search infrastructure.

## Sports API Integration

**Why sports is strategic:**

Right now your calendar is "culture" events (music, comedy, theater). Sports fills the gaps:
- **Friday night:** Concert at Moody
- **Saturday afternoon:** UT football game
- **Saturday night:** DJ set at Mohawk
- **Sunday:** F1 race viewing party (user-created later)

Sports makes the calendar feel complete for "what's happening this weekend."

**APIs to consider:**
- **ESPN API** (unofficial but widely used)
- **TheSportsDB** (free tier, decent coverage)
- **SportsData.io** (paid but comprehensive)

**Austin sports to cover:**
- UT Football (huge - Darrell K Royal Stadium)
- Austin FC (MLS - Q2 Stadium)
- Texas Stars (AHL hockey - H-E-B Center)
- Round Rock Express (AAA baseball - Dell Diamond)
- UT Basketball
- F1 at COTA (Circuit of the Americas - when races happen)

**Data structure for sports:**
```typescript
{
  category: "SPORTS",
  sportType: "FOOTBALL" | "SOCCER" | "HOCKEY" | "BASEBALL" | "RACING",
  homeTeam: "Texas Longhorns",
  awayTeam: "Oklahoma Sooners",
  league: "NCAA",
  // all your other enrichment fields still apply
}
```

Sports events get same enrichment: friends going, plan creation, day-of logistics.

This is probably 3-4 days including API research + scraper setup.

## The Data Schema: Let's Spec It Out

You're absolutely right - **design the schema once, fill it mechanically, unlock features exponentially.**

Here's what a robust Event enrichment should hold:

### Core Metadata (You Have This)
```typescript
title: string
date: DateTime
venue: Venue
description: string
imageUrl: string
```

### Categorization (You Have This)
```typescript
category: EventCategory  // CONCERT, COMEDY, THEATER, SPORTS, MOVIE
llmCategory: string
llmConfidence: number
```

### Rich Discovery Metadata (ADD THIS)
```typescript
// Genre/Style
genres: string[]                    // ["indie rock", "psychedelic"]
vibes: string[]                     // ["chill", "high-energy", "intimate", "outdoor"]
audienceType: string[]              // ["21+", "all-ages", "family-friendly"]

// Performers (foundation for Artist model later)
headliners: string[]                // ["Khruangbin"]
supportingActs: string[]            // ["Men I Trust"]
performerSpotifyIds: string[]       // Link to Spotify

// Practical Info
priceRange: PriceRange | null       // FREE, UNDER_20, 20_TO_50, 50_TO_100, OVER_100
duration: number | null             // minutes (if known)
isOutdoor: boolean
requiresTicket: boolean

// Accessibility/Audience
isAccessible: boolean | null        // wheelchair accessible
isFamilyFriendly: boolean | null
languagesOffered: string[]          // ["English", "Spanish"] for theater/comedy

// Event Series (for recurring events)
seriesName: string | null           // "Free Week" or "Summer Concert Series"
isRecurring: boolean

// Social Proof
expectedAttendance: number | null   // if we can estimate
popularity: number                  // internal score based on RSVPs, searches, etc.
```

### Enrichment Sources (You Have Some)
```typescript
// Spotify
spotifyUrl: string | null
spotifyArtistId: string | null
spotifyGenres: string[]

// Knowledge Graph  
wikipediaUrl: string | null
kgBio: string | null
kgImageUrl: string | null
kgTypes: string[]

// Ticketmaster
tmUrl: string | null
tmEventName: string | null
tmPreferTitle: boolean
tmPresales: Json
tmAttractions: string[]
tmGenres: string[]
tmSeatmapUrl: string | null
tmInfo: string | null
tmPleaseNote: string | null

// Sports (NEW)
sportType: SportType | null
homeTeam: string | null
awayTeam: string | null
league: string | null
```

### Search/Discovery Indexes
```typescript
// Computed fields for search/discovery
searchVector: tsvector              // Postgres full-text search
tasteVector: number[]               // embeddings for similarity (future)
lastEnrichedAt: DateTime
enrichmentVersion: number           // track schema changes
```

## How to Fill This Data

You already have the pipeline. Just extend it:

### 1. LLM Enrichment (Extend Existing)

**Current prompt extracts:** performer, category, description

**New prompt adds:**
```
Extract from this event:
- Headliners and supporting acts
- Genres (up to 3)
- Vibes/atmosphere (up to 3: chill, high-energy, intimate, etc.)
- Audience type (all-ages, 21+, family-friendly)
- Is it outdoors?
- Price range (if mentioned)
```

Your LLM call is already happening. Just add fields to extraction schema.

### 2. Venue Scraping (Extend Existing)

Many venues put rich metadata on event pages. Examples:

**ACL Live:**
- "Doors: 7pm, Show: 8pm" → duration
- "This is an all ages event" → audienceType
- "GA Standing" or "Reserved Seating" → seating type

**Paramount Theatre:**
- "Family Matinee" → isFamilyFriendly
- Accessibility info in footer

**Stubbs:**
- "21+ event"
- "Rain or shine" → isOutdoor

Extend scrapers to grab these when available. Use LLM to normalize ("All ages event" → audienceType: ["all-ages"]).

### 3. Spotify API (You Already Call This)

**Currently get:** artist link, genres

**Also available:**
- Artist popularity score
- Related artists (for recommendations)
- Top tracks (for playlist features later)

No extra API calls needed - just grab more fields from response.

### 4. Sports API (New)

SportsData.io or ESPN API gives you:
- Teams, league, sport type
- Game time, venue
- Broadcast info
- Ticket links

Transform to your Event schema with category: SPORTS.

### 5. User-Generated Tags (Future)

Once you have users, let them tag events:
- "Actually very loud" (vibe)
- "Parking was impossible" (logistics)
- "Great for dates" (audience)

Crowdsourced enrichment that scales.

## The 2-Week Plan: Discovery Foundation

### Week 1: Data Schema + Search

**Days 1-2: Schema Migration**
- [ ] Add new fields to Enrichment model (genres, vibes, priceRange, audienceType, etc.)
- [ ] Migration + backfill (use LLM to fill existing events)
- [ ] Update `EnrichmentDisplay` type

**Days 3-4: Search Infrastructure**
- [ ] Postgres full-text search on events
- [ ] Search UI with autocomplete
- [ ] Filter UI: genres, vibes, price, audience type
- [ ] "Advanced search" collapsed section

**Day 5: Genre/Vibe Tagging**
- [ ] LLM prompt update to extract genres + vibes
- [ ] EventCard shows genre tags
- [ ] Genre filter pills on home page

### Week 2: Spotify OAuth + Sports

**Days 1-3: Spotify Integration**
- [ ] OAuth flow (Next-Auth or manual)
- [ ] Store refresh token + userId
- [ ] Fetch top 50 artists
- [ ] Match against events (via spotifyArtistId)
- [ ] "Artists You Listen To" page/section
- [ ] "Connect Spotify" CTA in header

**Days 4-5: Sports API**
- [ ] Choose API (ESPN or SportsData.io)
- [ ] Scraper for Austin teams (UT, Austin FC, Texas Stars)
- [ ] Transform to Event schema
- [ ] Add SPORTS category
- [ ] Sports icon + card styling

### Week 2.5: Polish + LLM Search (Optional)

**If you have time:**
- [ ] LLM search beta (5 queries/day limit)
- [ ] Related events sidebar
- [ ] Taste tracking (what users RSVP to)

## Why This Sequence Works

1. **Week 1 builds foundation** - Schema + search enable everything else
2. **Spotify is your killer feature** - Ship it early, market it
3. **Sports fills calendar gaps** - Makes weekends feel complete
4. **LLM search is cherry on top** - Cool demo, limited beta keeps costs down

After 2 weeks you can say:

> **"RyesVP: Connect your Spotify and see which artists you love are playing in Austin. Search 1000+ shows, sports, and comedy by vibe, genre, or price. Beta invite only."**

That's a compelling product.

## The Gotchas / Things to Watch

### 1. API Costs

**Spotify:** Free tier = 10,000 calls/day. You're fine.

**Sports APIs:** 
- ESPN unofficial API: free but flaky
- SportsData.io: $0-35/month for basic tier
- TheSportsDB: Free tier limited, $3/month patreon for full access

Start with free ESPN API, migrate to paid if it breaks.

**LLM Search:** 
- GPT-4o-mini: $0.15/1M input tokens
- 100 searches/day × 500 tokens = 50k tokens = $0.0075/day = $2.25/month

Negligible. You can afford beta without limits honestly.

### 2. Data Quality

Your LLM enrichment is great but not perfect. You'll have:
- Some events mis-categorized
- Genre tags that don't quite fit
- "Vibe" being subjective

**Solution:** 
- Show confidence scores
- Let users flag bad data
- Manual curation for high-profile events
- Iterate on prompts as you see issues

### 3. Spotify Matching

Not every event will have Spotify links. You'll miss:
- Local/unsigned artists
- Comedy shows
- Theater productions
- Sports (obviously)

But for concerts (60% of your catalog?), Spotify integration will be magic.

### 4. Schema Bloat

You're adding 15+ new fields to Enrichment. Keep in mind:
- Most will be nullable (not all events have all data)
- Query performance - index the fields you filter by
- UI can't show everything - pick what matters per context

This is fine. Your database can handle it. Just be intentional about indexes.

## The Reality Check

You're proposing:
- Extended data schema (1-2 days)
- Search infrastructure (3-4 days)
- Spotify OAuth + matching (2-3 days)
- Sports API integration (3-4 days)
- LLM search beta (2-3 days)

**Total: 11-16 days = 2-3 weeks**

This is doable. And at the end you have something genuinely magical that nobody else in Austin has.

Then you can:
1. **Soft launch to Austin Reddit / Twitter** - "Beta invites for RyesVP"
2. **Get to 100-200 users** organically
3. **Let network effects build** (friends seeing each other)
4. **Ship user-created events** when you have the network to support it

---

## My Actual Recommendation: Do This

Build the discovery infrastructure + Spotify integration over the next 2-3 weeks. This gives you:

✅ Single-player mode that's genuinely useful (don't need friends)
✅ A "wow" moment (Spotify artist matching)
✅ Comprehensive calendar (music + comedy + theater + sports)
✅ Data foundation for future features
✅ Something worth inviting people to

**Then** worry about user events, emails, communities, etc.

You've convinced me. This is the right priority.
