# UX & Communications

You are working on user-facing copy, toasts, notifications, share texts, onboarding, or email templates.

## Key References

- `notes/reference/customer-comms.md` — All share text templates, notification copy, toast messages
- `notes/design/ui-reference.md` — Toast component patterns, onboarding flow
- `src/components/ui/Toast.tsx` — Toast component (success/info/error, 8s duration)
- `src/db/notifications.ts` — 9 notification types, display text computation
- `src/lib/share.ts` — Native share API (mobile) with clipboard fallback (desktop)

## Philosophy

All copy should highlight the **social graph** (friends, crews, groups) and **making plans/logistics easier** — ideally both. Core message: "This is where we organize together."

## Stub

This skill is a stub. Full content will be added when transactional emails or comms features are built. For now, reference the docs above.
