## Planning Workflow

1. Check `notes/ROADMAP.md` for current priority block and active items
2. Check `notes/specs/` for any existing spec on the topic
3. Use `notes/vision/product-vision.md` for strategic alignment
4. Create specs in `notes/specs/` for multi-session work
5. Move completed specs to `notes/archive/` when they become historical reference only
